### **Test Plan for GitHub UI and API Test Framework**

#### **1. Test Plan Overview**
This test plan outlines the strategy, objectives, scope, schedule, and resources for testing the GitHub UI and API Test Framework. It focuses on ensuring the functionality, performance, reliability, and security of the system.

---

#### **2. Objectives**
- Verify the functionality of the GitHub UI workflows such as login, repository management, issue tracking, and pull requests.
- Validate API operations for creating repositories, issues, and pull requests.
- Test the systemâ€™s performance under load and stress conditions.
- Ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.
- Confirm the robustness of the framework against edge cases and error scenarios.

---

#### **3. Scope**
- **In-Scope:**  
  - UI automation for GitHub login, repository, issue, and pull request workflows.  
  - API testing for repository, issue, and pull request management.  
  - Functional, performance, and compatibility testing.  
- **Out-of-Scope:**  
  - Third-party GitHub integrations.  
  - Testing of GitHub Enterprise-specific features.  

---

#### **4. Test Items**
- **UI Test Scenarios:**
  - Login functionality.
  - Repository creation, navigation, and deletion.
  - Issue creation and validation.
  - Pull request creation and merging.

- **API Test Scenarios:**
  - Repository operations: create, fetch details, delete.
  - Issue operations: create, update, fetch.
  - Pull request operations: create, validate merge, fetch.

---

#### **5. Testing Strategy**
- **Functional Testing:**  
  Validate each feature using positive, negative, and edge-case scenarios.  

- **Non-Functional Testing:**  
  Include performance, usability, and compatibility tests.  

- **Automation Testing:**  
  Use Selenium for UI automation and Python `requests` for API tests.  

- **Regression Testing:**  
  Ensure existing features work after new functionality or fixes.  

- **Security Testing:**  
  Check for secure handling of sensitive data and proper authentication.  

---

#### **6. Test Environment**
- **Browsers:**  
  - Google Chrome (latest version).  
  - Mozilla Firefox (latest version).  

- **Devices:**  
  - Desktop (Windows/Linux).  

- **Framework Dependencies:**  
  - Python 3.  
  - Selenium WebDriver.  
  - Pytest and related plugins (e.g., pytest-html).  

- **Configuration File:**  
  `config.yaml` will manage all environment-specific variables like browser choice, GitHub token, and repository details.

---

#### **7. Test Deliverables**
- **Test Artifacts:**  
  - Automated test scripts.  
  - Test data (`config.yaml`).  
  - Test reports (HTML reports generated by `pytest`).  

- **Documentation:**  
  - Test Plan (this document).  
  - Test Case Documentation.  
  - Manual Test Steps (test.md).

#### **8. Roles and Responsibilities**
| **Role**            | **Responsibility**                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Test Engineer        | Develop and execute test cases.          |
| Automation Engineer  | Automate test cases using Selenium/Pytest. |
| QA Lead              | Oversee the testing process and review results. |

---

#### **9. Risk Management**
- **Risks Identified:**
  - API rate limits might block tests.
  - Flaky UI tests due to inconsistent element locators.

- **Mitigation Plan:**
  - Use retries with exponential backoff for API requests.
  - Use explicit waits in UI tests to handle dynamic elements.
